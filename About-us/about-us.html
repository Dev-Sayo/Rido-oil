          <span>OUR STORY</span>
          <p>
            Born in the lush oil palm belt of Nigeria, Rido Palm Oil was
            established by a team of passionate entrepreneurs who recognized the
            untapped potential of locally sourced, high-quality palm oil. In a
            market flooded with inconsistent products, we vowed to stand out by
            prioritizing purity, freshness, and ethical sourcing. Today, we're
            proud to be a cornerstone of Nigeria's palm oil industry, blending
            traditional farming wisdom with modern processing techniques to
            ensure every drop meets the highest standards.
